# interpp
New version of my command shell written in C++. Taking my time with this, still in design phase. I have yet to build the thing as a whole unit yet. In this new version I'm promising to bring the same flexibility in adding new commands and parser functionality to the parser using modern C++/STL techniques to a command shell utility with a small footprint for embedded projects.<br>Long way to go on this; I'm essentially copying and pasting whole swaths of code from the first  linear C version which requires going back and working in modern STL where appropriate.
